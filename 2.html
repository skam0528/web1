<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[20] was released in that year,
featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was typically incomplete
and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser
achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000,
was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS 1 support,[31] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader
since its introduction of CSS support 15 months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterwards,
and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2.

However, even when later ‘version 5’ web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS,
they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs and other quirks.
 Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows, as opposed to the very different IE for Macintosh,
 had a seriously incorrect implementation of the ‘CSS box model’, as compared with the CSS standards.
 This is a set of rules that specify certain aspects of the sizing and layout of components of a web page.
 Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent
 appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters.
 The IE/Windows box model bugs were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released,
 Microsoft introduced a backwards-compatible mode of CSS interpretation (‘quirks mode’) plus an alternative,
 corrected 'standards mode'. Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided this very same ‘mode’-switch behavior capability.
 Unfortunately, ever since the release of IE 6 in 2001, it has become necessary for the authors of webpages’
 html files to make sure that the html contains a special distinctive ‘standards-compliant CSS intended’ marker
 to show that the authors intend CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being
 intended for the now long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker, web browsers that have the
 ‘quirks mode’-switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE5/Windows would rather than following CSS standards.
